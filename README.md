# BitTorrent Protocol

BitTorrent is a protocol used for downloading and distributing files across the Internet. Unlike the traditional client/server model where downloaders connect to a central server (such as watching a movie on Netflix, or loading the web page you're reading now), BitTorrent operates differently.

## Peer-to-Peer Protocol

In the BitTorrent network, participants are referred to as 'peers'. These peers download pieces of files from each other, making BitTorrent a peer-to-peer protocol. This decentralization is what sets it apart from traditional file distribution methods.
